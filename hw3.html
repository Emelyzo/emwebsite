<p> Okay so I am trying to do my homework but i lowkey forgot how to add an image and I am using linkdin tutorial and i am doing what she told me but i still can't figure out this photo thing. I think its the way my photos are like the PNG. I don't know.
<p> Okay it is 12:55 about forthy mintues since i wrote above and i figured it out but now I am confuse again. But I was able to get it done for my creative statment. Now I have to add my edited photos which is now hard cause i forgot how.
