<h1>Plato's Cave ⛰</h1>
<p>
  In Susan Sontag's, In Plato’s Cave, she explains her own interpretation of the tale. She uses the allegory of the Cave to defend her view of photography. Comparing Photography to the Cave, she explains that there is a sort of limit to knowledge. The Cave itself represents being limited from the world, the knowledge that the world has. The only way to know more is to get out of the cave, the cave that limits any knowledge.

<p>
In photography, we could see a photo, let’s just say a flower vase in the center of the image, we would think that’s it instead of digging deeper into what’s around the vase, the meaning of the vase, and the meaning in general. It is only a piece of the truth not the entire meaning. It could also show how a person could misinterpret and see false images of reality, like how the cave people saw the shadows and thought of a false reality themselves.

<p>
  If we look at other photos, especially photos that connect to historical events or propaganda, they either catch the truth or a false truth. Photography catches a part of the truth, but it’s based on how viewers interpret photos. But at times, photographers are biased, and want to show what they want and try to convince the viewer to support their point of view than than the reality behind the photo.

<p>
  It is about the connection the viewer has with the photos, and I have to agree. However, that doesn’t mean I think viewers have to make a connection with every photo they see but at least have one or two photos that they feel deep emotions for.

<p>
  But it’s also based on how the photo is presented. What is it trying to show? What is it trying to tell? That is up to the viewers to interpret. But also how the photographer set up their photos. Are they just giving a fragment of the truth or what they want other people to see, not the whole truth? That is how propaganda works too, misleading people to believe in a false truth. Advertising a set of beliefs, like how Sontag says some photographers do.

<p>
  As humans, we only want to see what we think is right, and we interpret things according to what we believe is right. So when photographers take a photo on some occasions those who are based tend to take the photo that would match their bias. I believe and agree with Sontag's opinion that people are filled with their own biases. I can imagine that we would try to persuade others to agree with our beliefs in various forms.

<p>
  I don’t really look at photos but the ones I did were for research for a book I am writing and because it is during historic events, I need to research about the events that happened and learn what life was like in that era. So it required looking at the photography taken in that era. And it was helpful in my writing but reading this article certainly makes me wonder if I have seen the full picture instead of what I saw in that specific photo.
